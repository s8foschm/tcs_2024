\section{Powerset}

Assume $|P(A)| = |A|$, then there is a bijection $f: A \to P(A)$.

Let $S \subseteq A$ be defined as:
\[
S = \{x \in A \mid x \notin f(x)\}.
\]

Now, because $f$ is bijective, $\exists a \in A$ such that $f(a) = S$. This implies that:
\[
a \in S \iff a \notin f(a) \iff a \notin S,
\]
which is a contradiction. 

Therefore, there exists no bijection, and $P(A)$ and $A$ do not have the same cardinality.
