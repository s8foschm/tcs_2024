\section{Pumping Lemma vs. Myhill-Nerode}

$$L = \left\{ x \in \left\{0,1\right\}^{\ast} \mid 11\text{ is a subword of }x\text{ or } \exists n \in \mathbb{N}:\#_{1}(x)=n^{2}\right\}$$

\subsection{(a)}
Let \( n = 4 \). \\
For all \( uvw \in L \): \( |v| \geq n \).

\subsection*{Case 1: \( uvw \in L \) because it contains \( 11 \)}


    (i) If \( v \) contains only 1s:\\ Pick \( y \) to be \( 11 \). Since we know that \( n = 4 \) and we are in the case that\( v \) contains only 1s, there are still 2 untouched consecutive 1s. If you pump down, and if you pump up, you still have 2 consecutive 1s.
    
    (ii) If \( v \) doesn’t contain \( 11 \):\\
        We know that \( |v| \geq n \), which implies there must be a zero. Pick \( y \) to be a zero.
    


\subsection*{Case 2: Perfect square and no \( 11 \)}

We have \( n = 4 \), \( |v| \geq n \), and \( uvw \) doesn’t have \( 11 \). This means \( v \) contains either only 0 or alternating \( 10 \). Pick \( y = 0 \).\\
Pumping \( y = 0 \) wouldn’t effect the word’s membership in the language.


\subsection{(b)}
We now want to show that L is regular by directly applying the Myhill-Nerode Theorem to L.\\
We do that by showing that $\sim_{L}$ has infinitely many equivalence classes.\\
The Myhill-Nerode relation is defined as follows:\\
$x\sim_{L}y= [\forall z \in \sigma^{\ast}: xz \in L \Leftrightarrow yz \in L]$\\
Let $i,j \in \mathbb{N}, i \neq j$. Pick 2 equivalence classes and show they're distinct.\\
We pick:
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $0^{i}1$
    \item $0^{j}10^{j}$
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}
We append $(10)^{k}$ to both of these expressions, with $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}: k+1 \neq n^{2}$.\\
We then get:
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $0^{i}1(10)^k \in L$ since it contains the string 11
    \item $0^{j}10^{j}(10)^k \notin L$ since it doesn't contain 11 at any point, and it contains $k+1$ 1s, where $k+1 \neq n^{2}$ due to our definition of $k$
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-5mm}
Therefore $[0^{i}]_{\sim_{L}}$ and $[0^{j}10^{j}]_{\sim_{L}}$ are pairwise distinct equivalence classes of $\sim_{L}$ $\forall i,j \in \mathbb{N}$.\\
This proves that $\sim_{L}$ has an infinite number of equivalence classes, which makes $L$ not regular according to the Myhill-Nerode Theorem. $\square$
