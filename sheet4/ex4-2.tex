\section{Non-regular languages}

\subsection{(a)}
\[
A = \{1^{3^n} \mid n \in \mathbb{N}\}
\]

To show that \( A \) is non-regular, we show that \( \mathbb{N}_A \) has infinite index.

Pick 2 distinct equivalence classes \(1^i\) and \(1^j\) , \( i \neq j \) , \( i, j \in \mathbb{N} \), \( k \in \mathbb{N} \)

\[
1^i 1^k \in A  \quad  , \exists n \in \mathbb{N}:i + k = 3^n
\]

\[
1^j 1^k \notin A  \quad  , \nexists n \in \mathbb{N}:j + k = 3^n
\]

Chose $i$ and $j$ arbitarily.

We can choose a $k \in \mathbb{N} \) such that \( \exists  n \in \mathbb{N}: \, i + k = 3^n$ and $\nexists  n \in \mathbb{N}: \, j + k = 3^n$. 

Therefore we have shown that there infinitely many equivalence classes, which implies that A is not regular by the Myhill-Nerode Theorem.

\subsection{(b)}
 \[
B = \left\{ x \in \{ 0, 1 \}^* \mid \#_0(x) > \#_1(x) \right\} 
\]

Show that B is non-regular using the Myhill-Nerode Theorem:

Pick 2 distinct equivalence classes $0^i 1^{i-1}$ and $0^i 1^{i-10}$.

\[
0^i 1^{i-1} 1^k \notin A , \quad 1 \leq k \leq 10
\]

\[
0^j 1^{j-10}\ 1^k \in A, \quad 1 \leq k \leq 10
\]

Chose i, j arbitarily with \( i \neq j \). For every $i$ and $j$, we can chose a $k \in \mathbb{N}$ with $1 \leq k \leq 10$, such that the equations above hold.\\
We have shown that there are infinitely many equivalence classes. Therefore B is not regular by the Myhill-Nerode Theorem.
