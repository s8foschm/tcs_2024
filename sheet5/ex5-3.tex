\section{Even more syntactical sugar}

To achieve this, we need the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We need to keep track that \texttt{return x} is called at most once.
    \item The returned value \texttt{x} must be saved in \texttt{$x_0$} and never overwritten afterward.
\end{enumerate}

To achieve this, we introduce two variables that may only be changed by a \texttt{return x} statement: \texttt${x_{returned}$ := 0;} and \texttt{$x_{return\_val}$}, and this must be done before entering the loop.

Now, when simulating a \texttt{return x} in a \textbf{WHILE} program \texttt{P = while $x_i \neq 0$ do $P_1$ od}, the \texttt{return x} statement itself is simulated as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
if x_{returned} = 0 then
    x_0 := 0;
    x_{return\_val} := x + x_0;
    x_{returned} := 1;
    x_i := 0;
else
    x_{dummy\_variable} := 0;
fi;
\end{verbatim}

In this statement, \texttt{$x_i$} is set to 0 to ensure the \texttt{WHILE} loop terminates after this iteration. We want our return value to be stored in \texttt{$x_0$}, so we must ensure that the final modification to \texttt{$x_0$} is the value of \texttt{x}. To implement this in both \texttt{FOR} and \texttt{WHILE} programs, the last part of the loop must be:

\begin{verbatim}
if x_{returned} != 0 then
    x_0 := 0;
    x_0 := x_{return\_val} + x_0;
else
    x_{dummy\_variable}++;
fi;
\end{verbatim}

In contrast to a \texttt{WHILE} program, a \textbf{FOR} program \texttt{P = for $x_i$ do $P_1$ od} will not terminate before completing $x_i$ iterations. Therefore, the statement \texttt{$x_i$ := 0} is not needed in a \texttt{FOR} program. The simulation of the \texttt{return x} statement itself would then be:

\begin{verbatim}
if x_{returned} = 0 then
    x_0 := 0;
    x_{return\_val} := x + x_0;
    x_{returned} := 1;
else
    x_{dummy\_variable} := 0;
fi;
\end{verbatim}
