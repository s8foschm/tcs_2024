\section{\textsc{NP}-Reductions}

Show the reduction $\text{IS}\leq_{P}\text{Clique}$.

$$\text{IS}:=\left\{(G,k)\mid G\text{ is an undirected graph with a }k\text{-independent set}\right\}$$
$$\text{Clique}:=\left\{(G,k)\mid G\text{ is an undirected graph with a }k\text{-clique}\right\}$$

To prove the reduction $\text{IS}\leq_{P}\text{Clique}$, we need to find a function which maps inputs of \texttt{IS} to inputs of \texttt{Clique}.\\
Consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. Build the complement graph $\overline{G} = (V, \overline{E})$ where $\forall v_{1}, v_{2} \in V: (v_{1},v_{2}) \in \overline{E} \leftrightarrow (v_{1},v_{2}) \notin E$. This is obviously computable in polynomial time, by checking for every combination of nodes whether it is in the original edge set or not.

To prove the correctness, we must show two separate statements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $G$ has an independent set $\rightarrow$ $\overline{G}$ has a clique
    \item $G$ has no independent set $\rightarrow$ $\overline{G}$ has no clique
\end{itemize}
For the first case, we assume that $G$ has an independent set. This is, by definition, a subset $I\subseteq V$ of nodes $I = \left\{v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{k}\right\}$ where $\forall v_{1},v_{2} \in I: (v_{1},v_{2})\notin E$. By the definition of the complement graph stated above, this directly implies $\forall v_{1},v_{2} \in I: (v_{1},v_{2})\in \overline{E}$. This directly implies that $\overline{E}$ has a clique, so we are done with this case.\\
We prove the second case by contraposition, so we attempt to show that\\
\phantom{x}\hspace{0.4cm}$G$ has a clique $\rightarrow$ $\overline{G}$ has an independent set\\
holds.\\
$G$ has a clique, which by definition means that there is a subset $C\subseteq V$ of nodes $C = \left\{v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{k}\right\}$ where $\forall v_{1},v_{2} \in C: (v_{1},v_{2})\in E$. By the definition of the complement graph stated above, this directly implies $\forall v_{1},v_{2} \in V: (v_{1},v_{2})\notin \overline{E}$. This directly implies that $\overline{E}$ has an independent set, so we are done with this case.

We have provided a reduction function, shown that it runs in polynomial time and shown its correctness, so we have indeed shown $\text{IS}\leq_{P}\text{Clique}$.
