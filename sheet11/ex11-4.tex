\section{Busy Beaver}

$$\text{BB}(n) := \text{max}\left\{\text{Time}_{M}(\varepsilon)\mid M\text{ is a TM with }n\text{ states that halts on input }\varepsilon\right\}$$

We want to prove that the Busy Beaver function is not computable by any Turing Machine.

Proof by contradiction: assume that there is a Turing Machine $M$ which computes the Busy Beaver function. This Turing Machine would allow us to decide whether a given Turing Machine halts on input $\varepsilon$, which is the halting problem for Turing Machines.\\
More specifically, any Turing Machine with $n$ states would have to halt after at most $n$ steps, by the definition of the Busy Beaver function. Considering any other Turing Machine $M'$ with $n$ states, if it has not halted after $n$ steps, we could say for sure that it would never halt, since it halting after more than $n$ steps would contradict the definition of the Busy Beaver function.\\
We see that computing the Busy Beaver function would allow us to solve the Halting Problem for Turing machines. Since we know that the Halting Problem is not decidable, this is a contradiction which disproves our original assumption. So, we have shown that the Busy Beaver function is not computable by any Turing Machine.
