\section{More than just one Quine}

Consider a Quine $Q \in W$, which is \textsc{WHILE}-Program which returns its own Gödel number $g\ddot{o}d(W)$.\\
Such a Quine could look like this:
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Original Quine $Q$}
x := god(Q)\\
return x
\end{algorithm}
We can modify this quine to include, as an argument, a number $k \in \NN$.
\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Modified Quine $Q_{k}$}
x := god($Q_{k}$)\\
y := k\\
return x
\end{algorithm}
Since these programs have different source codes (explicitely different because $k$ is always a different value), they also have different Gödel numbers.\\
From this, we have created one different Quine in \textsc{WHILE} for every $n\in\NN$. This means that there are infinitely many Quines. $\square$
